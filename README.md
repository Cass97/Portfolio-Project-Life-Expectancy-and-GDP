# Portfolio-Project-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
Open-ended project to conclude Codecademy Data Visualisation modules.
I was provided with a CSV file and it was left to me as to what observations I wished to make and what relationships I wished to explore.
This project provided an opportunity to learn, practice and apply skills relating to Python libraries such as Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn.
It also demonstrates a practical understanding of exploratory data analysis and effective data visualisation.
